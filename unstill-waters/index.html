<hr>
<p class="p1">Jack</p>
<p class="p3">Retired Detective Jack Mallory should have gotten the hint from Mother Nature when she rained on him the entire drive back to Charleston, South Carolina. When he finally drove past the “Welcome to Charleston” sign and its candy-colored colonial homes, he realized it hadn’t been long enough since he’d left this touristy town on prozac. It was the end of July, and old couples with money to blow were starting to move in as the families with screaming little shits were packing up. One convertible of old farts quite literally waited on a spot as a family of four rushed around and disappeared into the sides of their minivan. The two parents, in their late twenties or early thirties, waved with tired smiles as the boomers slid into their spot and took over where they left off.</p>
<p class="p3">Jack could only imagine the kind of conversation these people with too much money to stay at home and eat frozen dinners would be having.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>“Hey, Honey, I wish we could stay a couple more weeks,” the young father says to his wife with breasts still above her navel.</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>“Yes, Dear, but I think we’d have to drown the kids in the pool first.” She looks in the back seats where the boy and girl play on their devices, clueless to their mom’s threats of homicide.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>“Ha, ha, ha,” the father laughs jovially. “But, Honey, don’t they make the trip even more fun?”</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>The old guy in a Hawaiian shirt and straw hat steps out of the sporty car that he never drives above fifty, and says, “Please take your little shits and get the fuck out of here already. This is our town now, you worthless fucking millennials!”</i></p>
<p class="p3">A loud car horn sounds behind Jack’s Crown Vic, which he bought at the police auction. He has a sound mind to grab his 38 Special and scare the shit out of the asshole behind him, but he decides to leave that for another day and rolls through the light and down the road following the College of Charleston signs.</p>
<p class="p3">As he neared the campus, the rain began to ease, and the sun came out. By the time Jack had found a parking spot by the Chemistry department offices, he was wishing for more clouds and rain. The sun had come out in full force and had begun beating down on his poor, unconditioned retired cop car. Jack got out of that hotbox before the engine even finished sputtering, only to find that the sun was equally hot outside that black sedan with a grey interior. He began to sweat through his Walmart polo within seconds of shutting the door and stomping toward the old college buildings. Surely these buildings had some cooler air.</p>
<p class="p3">He pulled open the heavy metal door to the first building he could reach before he melted in the South Carolina heat. Unfortunately, much to his disdain, he felt no rush of cool air. Instead, he was met by wet, stale air with a hint of something chemically not too unlike the antiseptic odors of an active wing at a large hospital. There was, however, the slightest inkling of something else Jack couldn’t quite put his finger on. Something that made his stomach turn from the gas station burger he had downed at the last fill-up. He paused, leaning on the wall as his heart beat erratically. The old ticker was “old man strong” for short bursts of action, but he often found himself unsteady, and his vision blurred on the backside.</p>
<p class="p3">He sniffed the air again, trying to place that smell. In his former line of work, he’d smelled all kinds of stuff, mostly dead, rotting or in some level of decay. Still, occasionally, he found himself in the midst of a new smell that made him long for the moment he saw a body decaying at the fertilizer factory dump.</p>
<p class="p3">“Rotten butter?” he asked, no one in particular. He sniffed again. “Sweaty socks?” That second assessment left him even more confused. This wasn’t a hole-in-the-wall restaurant or an inner city gym, so those didn’t fit.</p>
<p class="p3">Someone came up on him, and he instinctively placed his hand on his piece.</p>
<p class="p3">“Butyric Acid.” A young brunette, less than half his age and weight, stepped into his vision. “You won’t be needing <i>that</i> here, Mr. Policeman. We use <i>our</i> superpowers for good.”</p>
<p class="p3">Jack looked down at his hand resting on the butt of his revolver’s handgrip. “Oh, sorry, sweetie, but I’m not a cop anymore.” He pushed off the wall, stood up straight, and adjusted his shirt, now soaked through at the armpits.</p>
<p class="p3">She noted the round wet spot in the middle of the shirt, just above his well-earned beer belly and just below his man boobies. “Well, that’s a relief, because if I were looking for you to save me from some football player trying to have his way with me, I’d just have to stop and spread ‘em because you’re never going to make it in time.”</p>
<p class="p3">He gave her the look he used to give his daughter when she saw fit to razz him on all manner of bad choices he’d made in his life. As with her, he had no rebut.</p>
<p class="p3">“I’m looking for a Dr…Volk…nerr,” he said without an ounce of confidence, then searched his pockets for the little notepad he’d left in the car.</p>
<p class="p3">“Volkov,” she said. “You’re looking for Vox.” She turned and walked down the corridor, waving one hand for him to follow.</p>
<p class="p3">That was where he was in life. Being dressed down by a girl not even in her twenties, then following her to the person he could not locate on his own. He’d been retired way too long.</p>
